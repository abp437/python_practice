Why are Web frameworks like Django & Ruby on Rails still relevant? Why haven't big companies like GitHub, Instagram switched their main tech stacks from slower languages like Ruby(Ruby on Rails) and Python(Django) to faster languages like Golang to improve performance even though they have all the resources like money and talented people?
  Big companies like GitHub and Instagram often stick with their original tech stacks, such as Ruby on Rails and Django, even when faster languages like Go (Golang) are available, for several reasons:

  1. Legacy Systems and Technical Debt:
    Migrating from an established tech stack to a new one involves significant complexity. Legacy systems are often deeply integrated with business logic, and rewriting or migrating them can be risky and costly. There’s also technical debt, which includes custom solutions and optimizations specific to the existing stack. Migrating means dealing with this debt, which can be impractical.

  2. Cost of Migration:
    Transitioning to a new tech stack requires extensive resources, including development time, retraining staff, and ensuring that the new system meets all existing requirements. The cost and risk of these efforts can be substantial. There’s also the risk of introducing bugs or performance issues in the new system.

  3. Optimization and Tuning:
    Before considering a complete tech stack change, companies often explore optimizations and performance improvements within their current stack. Technologies like Ruby on Rails and Django offer various tools and techniques for enhancing performance, such as caching and database tuning.

  4. Development Velocity and Productivity:
    Frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django are designed to enhance developer productivity with built-in conventions and tools. The speed of development and ease of use provided by these frameworks often outweigh the performance benefits of switching to a lower-level language.

  5. Community and Ecosystem:
    Ruby on Rails and Django have extensive ecosystems with libraries, plugins, and community support. This rich ecosystem can accelerate development and problem-solving, making it a strong reason to stay with the existing stack.

  6. Current Performance Adequacy:
    For many applications, the performance of Ruby or Python is sufficient, especially when combined with optimizations and good architectural practices. If performance issues can be managed within the current framework, there is less incentive to switch.

  7. Gradual Transition Strategies:
    Instead of a full migration, companies may adopt new technologies alongside their existing stack. For instance, they might implement new microservices in Go while keeping the main application in Ruby on Rails or Python. This allows them to benefit from new technologies without completely overhauling their systems.

  8. Strategic Decisions:
    Strategic decisions consider factors beyond just performance, such as development costs, time to market, and team expertise. Maintaining the existing stack might align better with long-term business goals and operational strategies.

  In summary, companies often stick with their existing tech stacks due to the complexity and cost of migration, adequate performance with optimizations, and the benefits of developer productivity and ecosystem support. They may adopt new technologies gradually rather than making a full switch, balancing the benefits of new technologies with the risks and costs of migration.
