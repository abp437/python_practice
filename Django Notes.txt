We need to have virtual environment defined for ourselves in each Python project to keep the dependencies isolated for each project. We do that using `virtualenv` or `venv`. The command to run it is: `virtualenv <env_name>`

We can activate that environment using `source env/bin/activate` in terminal in the Project's Root directory.
After this we have entered the Virtual Environment. In it we can install all the necessary packages and those packages will be installed inside the `<env_name>` folder like we have the `node_modules` folder in NodeJS apps in the Project's Root directory. We need to activate it every time whenever we need to run our Python project.

Main commands:
django-admin makemigrations
django-admin migrate
django-admin runserver
django-admin startapp
django-admin startproject

To create a new project:
django-admin startproject <project_name>

Now navigate to the project.
To run migrations:
python3 manage.py migrate

To run server:
python3 manage.py runserver

Important files:
settings.py - It's like config.rb file in Rails
urls.py - It's like routes.rb file in Rails
manage.py - Contains all the commands to run migrations and start the server

To create an App within the Project:
python3 manage.py startapp <app_name>

An App within Python is just a directory which contains files like of views, models, admin, apps, migrations folder, etc.
View files in Django are gonna fire queries to the DB. Templates are the files which contains the actual HTML content in it.
