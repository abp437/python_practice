Problem Statement:
  I have a popup where I have a user list. where I have a button for each user who makes an Update in the database with if successful I would like my page not to close the popup and update the popup. so I can see they have updated the page without me being needed. to refresh. so it should download update automatically

My Pitch:
  Hi Rene F.,
  As I gather the info provided, it seems that most of the work in the project needs to be done in JavaScript. Two reasons:
  - There seems to be an issue with synchronizing the Response of the Back End API properly in the popup.
  - It seems that the Popup is closing right now on an update made by a user in the user list, so we just need to prevent it by JavaScript Event handling.

  So, as you can see I have spotted the problems and have given hints to the solution as well.

  I am a Full Stack Engineer with expertise in delivering great software to my customers. I have worked in Vanilla JS, React JS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL as well. If the need be I can even improvise the User Interface of the Popup to give a seamless experience.

  So, just give me an opportunity to work for you and fix the problems and make the project better.
  I am available to connect as I am a Full Time Freelancer.

  Just to give you a glimpse of my work in Front End, here's a mini project which I built in Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3:
