Topics to learn in Python:
  Modules/Packages - Done
  **kwargs - Done
  Magic methods/Dunder methods - Double Underscore functions like `__sizeof__`, `__init__`, `__str__` - Done
  OOPs - Static & class methods
  Decorators
  Data Classes - Used heavily
  Lambda functions
  Iterators
  List comprehensions and generators instead of For Loops.
  Use virtual envs to encapsulate dependencies for different projects.
  Use Unit tests for functions - pytest, unittest
  Meta Classes
  Abstract Classes

It wasn't possible in JS or Ruby or Go lang for that matter.

Fun Fact:
Instagram was built using Django. Django is still an integral part of Instagram's tech stack.
