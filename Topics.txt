Topics to learn in Python:
  Modules/Packages - Done
  **kwargs - Done
  OOPs
  Decorators
  Lambda functions
  Iterators
  Double Underscore functions like `__sizeof__`, `__init__`
  List comprehensions and generators instead of For Loops.
  Use virtual envs to encapsulate dependencies for different projects.
  Use Unit tests for functions - pytest, unittest

It wasn't possible in JS or Ruby or Go lang for that matter.

Fun Fact:
Instagram was built using Django and Django still is  an integral part of Instagram's stack.
