Topics to learn in Python:
  Modules/Packages - Done
  Double Underscore functions like `__sizeof__`, `__init__`
  OOPs
  Decorators
  List comprehensions and generators instead of For Loops.
  Use virtual envs to encapsulate dependencies for different projects.
  Use Unit tests for functions

A great thing about Python is that we can directly see the library code with the use of `Go to definition` function of VSCode or any other Code Editor.
It wasn't possible in JS or Ruby or Go lang for that matter.
